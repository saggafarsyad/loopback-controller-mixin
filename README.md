# Controller Mixin for Loopback

A mixin to separate remote method from Model file and hides pre-defined remote methods

## Features
1. Define remote method in a separated controller file, so remote method handlers and settings won't pollute your model
1. Hide all pre-defined remote methods by default. Shows only certain methods by whitelisting
1. Hide remote methods by blacklisting (example User.login, User.logout)

## TODOs
[ ] Usage documentation
[ ] API documentation
[ ] Write test
